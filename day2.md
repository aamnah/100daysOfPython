### Data types

- Strings `"Hello"`
- Integers (whole numbers) `123`
- Floats (decimal point numbers) `13.4`
- Booleans `True` and `False` (case-sensitive)

- Underscores in `int`s are ignored. You can write them for your own readability if you want. For example, `100,000` can be written as `100_000` and it'd be the same as `100000`

### Type checking

You can find the type of data with the aptly named `type()` function

### Type Casting

_Casting_ means changing the data type. It means _converting_ the data types, for example make a string an int and such. Programmers like their jargon, just like other professions. Just like how a doctor would say _myocardial infarction_ instead of saying a _a heart attack_.

### Math

| operator | description                                      |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `+`      | add                                              |
| `-`      | subtract / minus                                 |
| `*`      | multiply                                         |
| `**`     | exponent                                         |
| `/`      | divide (returns `float` value)                   |
| `//`     | floor (returns `int` value)                      |
| `%`      | modulus (gives you the remainder after division) |

- Order of priority is a thing. _PEMDAS: Parenthesis > Exponents > Multiplication / Division > Addition / Subtraction_
- `P`, `E`, `MD`, `AS` from _left to right_.
